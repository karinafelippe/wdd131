## Weeks

### Week 01
 #### Learning Activity
 - HTML and CSS Review

 This learning activity is a review of HTML and CSS layout principles, focusing on core layout design and development. Mastering the workflow process – writing code in VS Code, testing, committing, and pushing your work to your GitHub repository – is critical to your success in the course.

- Introduction to JavaScript

 JavaScript is a popular, well-supported programming language used to create interactive and dynamic web pages, mobile apps, desktop applications and more. It is a high-level, interpreted language that is designed to run in web browsers and it can also be used on the server-side with the help of technologies like Node.js.
In this class you will learn to apply your prerequisite, programming knowledge to the web using JavaScript. This language uses the same principles and common control structures as other programming languages such as Python and C#.

- JavaScript Variables

Variables are used to store values. These values can be primitive like a number, string, Boolean, or null or they can be objects like a function, class, or literal object. The values can be used as input to expressions, be used in processing, or be used in output to display information.

 #### Assignment
 This assignment allows you to demonstrate your prerequisite knowledge by applying HTML and CSS in the design and development of a home page. In addition, you will need to apply learning activity concepts – including JavaScript – to provide some dynamic information to the home page.

 #### Task
Design and develop the following home page as your wdd131 course landing page. Use your own content and basic styling.

### Week 02
 #### Learning Activity

 - CSS Media Queries

 CSS media queries let you apply different styles to your website based on the characteristics of the device being used to view your site. They allow the website to adapt to different screen sizes, orientations, and even user preferences.

 - JavaScript Constructs

 Through the prerequisite programming courses, you have built a foundational understanding of common, programming constructs, including operators, expressions, decision structures, loops, and functions. This activity focuses on a few of the common control structures in programming.

 - Document Object Model

 A key skill for any frontend web developer is the ability to manipulate DOM (DOM), a JavaScript object that is created after the browser initially renders the document. Manipulating the DOM means to read, edit, update, or delete the document, including CSS properties, dynamically. Essentially, the DOM is the outline of the HTML and content nodes.
 The purpose of this activity is to introduce the HTML DOM and to learn how to manipulate the document using JavaScript.

 - Handling DOM Events

 Handling DOM events in JavaScript is a fundamental part of building interactive web pages. In this activity, you'll learn all about the different events you can handle, how to handle them, and how to pass data between the event handler and the rest of your code.

> "Events are things that happen in the system you are programming – the system produces (or "fires") a signal of some kind when an event occurs, and provides a mechanism by which an action can be automatically taken (that is, some code running) when the event occurs. Events are fired inside the browser window, and tend to be attached to a specific item that resides in it. " – MDN 

 - Responsive Menus

 The purpose of this activity is to build a responsive menu using JavaScript. The menu will adapt to different viewport sizes and also respond when the user clicks on a "hamburger" button (≡). In responsive design, our objective is to provide users with a positive and familiar experience.

 - JavaScript Debugging

 Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in your code. This is an essential skill for any developer. You will learn how to use the browser's DevTools to debug your JavaScript code.

#### Assignment
 This assignment applies the concepts presented in the learning activities to a picture album page that is responsive in small and larger views. This page will utilize a 'hamburger' menu and respond to user requests.

#### Task
 Design, develop, test, and then deploy a temple album page using your own selections of temple pictures.

### Week 03
 #### Learning Activity

 - Design Principles
 Good design principles are essential in web design to create a positive and engaging user experience. One goal of this course is to provide a strong foundation in effective web design. These principles should be understood, practiced, and continuously applied. Improving your skills takes practice and actively seeking constructive feedback from others.

    > "Effective web design and art are not the same. But many psychological and design principles apply to websites. You can design a great website by applying the relevant aspects of those laws to your layout, typography, and images. Design for the user and your business objectives." – Peep Laja – CXL

 - CSS Pseudo Selection
 Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements enhance the abilities and/or content of specific selectors. A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element. For example, it can change the color of a button when the user hovers over it with their cursor. A pseudo-element styles specific parts of an element, such as the first letter or the first line of a paragraph.

 - Image File Formats
 You have worked with various image formats some of which are better suited for the web. Responsive image design aims to reduce page weights and deliver optimized for different screen sizes. This activity explores the SVG (Scalar Vector Graphic) and the WebP image formats, which offer better compression for faster page loads.

    > "_WebP_ is a modern image format that provides superior lossless and lossy compression for images on the web. Using WebP, webmasters and web developers can create smaller, richer images that make the web faster." – developers.google.com

    > The _Scalable Vector Graphic_ or _SVG_ format is a vector image format that is used for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. "As such, it's a text-based, open Web standard for describing images that can be rendered cleanly at any size and are designed specifically to work well with other web standards including CSS, DOM, JavaScript, and SMIL. SVG is, essentially, to graphics what HTML is to text." – MDN

 - Responsive Images
 The work of responsive image design is to support smaller page weights and to deliver content on screen size. You have worked on basic image optimization using image types, sizing, and quality level adjustments. You also need to be aware of the image's appearance on different screen sizes. This activity's objective is to reduce page weight while being conscious of image clarity and functionality on different screen sizes and viewports (the visible area of a web page).

    > "Serving desktop-sized images to mobile devices can use 2-4x more data than needed. Instead of a "one-size-fits-all" approach to images, serve different image sizes to different devices. How many image versions should you create? There is no single 'correct' answer to this question. However, it's common to serve 3-5 different sizes of an image. Serving more image sizes is better for performance, but will take up more space on your servers and require writing a tiny bit more HTML." – Web.dev

 - JavaScript Arrays
 An array is a data structure that stores a multiple values in a single variable instead of declaring separate variables for each value.

 - JavaScript Functions
 Functions in JavaScript are common programming control structures. They are blocks of code that can be called by name multiple times throughout a program to perform specific tasks. Functions can receive input data and return output data back to the caller.

    > "Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it. – MDN"


#### Assignment
 In this assignment, you will apply the concepts from the learning activities to the design and development of a web page. The subject of the page is a country or place where you live, have visited, or wish to visit. There are specific, functional and developmental requirements for the page's layout, design, and content.

#### Task
 Design and build a single webpage using the following wireframe as the layout and content location guide:
