The course introduces responsive design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with attention to usability, accessibility, and best practices in web frontend development. This two-credit course builds on prior experience in Web Fundamentals and programming. Students will learn to create dynamic websites that use JavaScript to respond to events, update content, and create responsive user experiences. 

## Versions

For each workflow a new version will be implanted.
The pattern for this repository will follow:

    - First digit: week
    - Second digit: 1 for release, 2 for fix, 3 for README
    - Third digit: number of commits

## Naming Conventions

Standard folder names for our sites/subfolders are:
- styles - Folders with this name contain CSS files.
- images - Folders with this name contain images.
- scripts - Folders with this name contain JavaScript files.

## Weeks

### Week 01
 #### Learning Activity
 - HTML and CSS Review

 This learning activity is a review of HTML and CSS layout principles, focusing on core layout design and development. Mastering the workflow process – writing code in VS Code, testing, committing, and pushing your work to your GitHub repository – is critical to your success in the course.

- Introduction to JavaScript

 JavaScript is a popular, well-supported programming language used to create interactive and dynamic web pages, mobile apps, desktop applications and more. It is a high-level, interpreted language that is designed to run in web browsers and it can also be used on the server-side with the help of technologies like Node.js.
In this class you will learn to apply your prerequisite, programming knowledge to the web using JavaScript. This language uses the same principles and common control structures as other programming languages such as Python and C#.

- JavaScript Variables

Variables are used to store values. These values can be primitive like a number, string, Boolean, or null or they can be objects like a function, class, or literal object. The values can be used as input to expressions, be used in processing, or be used in output to display information.

 #### Assignment
 This assignment allows you to demonstrate your prerequisite knowledge by applying HTML and CSS in the design and development of a home page. In addition, you will need to apply learning activity concepts – including JavaScript – to provide some dynamic information to the home page.

 #### Task
Design and develop the following home page as your wdd131 course landing page. Use your own content and basic styling.

### Week 02
 #### Learning Activity1

 - CSS Media Queries

 CSS media queries let you apply different styles to your website based on the characteristics of the device being used to view your site. They allow the website to adapt to different screen sizes, orientations, and even user preferences.

 - JavaScript Constructs

 Through the prerequisite programming courses, you have built a foundational understanding of common, programming constructs, including operators, expressions, decision structures, loops, and functions. This activity focuses on a few of the common control structures in programming.

 - Document Object Model

 A key skill for any frontend web developer is the ability to manipulate DOM (DOM), a JavaScript object that is created after the browser initially renders the document. Manipulating the DOM means to read, edit, update, or delete the document, including CSS properties, dynamically. Essentially, the DOM is the outline of the HTML and content nodes.
 The purpose of this activity is to introduce the HTML DOM and to learn how to manipulate the document using JavaScript.

 - Handling DOM Events

 Handling DOM events in JavaScript is a fundamental part of building interactive web pages. In this activity, you'll learn all about the different events you can handle, how to handle them, and how to pass data between the event handler and the rest of your code.

> "Events are things that happen in the system you are programming – the system produces (or "fires") a signal of some kind when an event occurs, and provides a mechanism by which an action can be automatically taken (that is, some code running) when the event occurs. Events are fired inside the browser window, and tend to be attached to a specific item that resides in it. " – MDN 

 - Responsive Menus

 The purpose of this activity is to build a responsive menu using JavaScript. The menu will adapt to different viewport sizes and also respond when the user clicks on a "hamburger" button (≡). In responsive design, our objective is to provide users with a positive and familiar experience.

 - JavaScript Debugging

 Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in your code. This is an essential skill for any developer. You will learn how to use the browser's DevTools to debug your JavaScript code.

#### Assignment
 This assignment applies the concepts presented in the learning activities to a picture album page that is responsive in small and larger views. This page will utilize a 'hamburger' menu and respond to user requests.

#### Task
 Design, develop, test, and then deploy a temple album page using your own selections of temple pictures.
